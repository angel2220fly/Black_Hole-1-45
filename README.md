Black hole 1.0.0.0 Quantum Compression Software for future technology

Algorithm Jurijus Pacalovas

Arithmetic Method by formula:

Number_of_the_file =((((Number_of_the_file * Square_of_ROOT) + Add_Numbers) // 3) * Multiply)

Memory need of RAM (32 bits / 8 bits per byte = 4 bytes). 2^26 Bytes â‰ˆ 64 MB Qubits need 805306370

Maximum k2=( 2^{(2^{(2^{(255 \times 8)})})} + 1)+ (infinity)


Times compress 1-255

From center to the top and save position. File Check that the size of the block same size or less or if 01 is 1 bit bigger and fractal manipulation of bits about 2^26 varations En 6-8191 Author: Jurijus Pacalovas Quantum Software

Algorithm Black Hole 44: 2**n long of it finds 4 numbers of it save two lengths: lengths before, after and binary representation of times. Also, saves times.
